# nf-core/yascp: Output

## Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the outputs generated by the pipeline.

The pipeline will create the following files in your working directory:

```console
work            # Directory containing the nextflow working files
results         # Finished results (configurable, see below)
.nextflow_log   # Log file from Nextflow
# Other nextflow hidden files, eg. history of pipeline runs and old logs.
```

## Pipeline Overview

Utilizing [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/), our pipeline orchestrates a series of data processing steps. The structure of the overall results folder is outlined below, offering a snapshot of the diverse outputs from different stages of the pipeline:

![Results Folder Structure](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp/assets/22347136/12cc3575-8772-43ee-b64d-bb396e10ba82)

The pipeline delivers outputs across several key areas:

- **[CellSNP](#cellsnp)**: Variant calling on single cells.
- **[Cell Type Identification](#celltype-identification)**: Classification of cells into types.
- **[CITE-seq Data Processing](#citeseq)**: Handling of CITE-seq (Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing) data.
- **[Clustering and Integration](#integration-and-clustering)**: Grouping cells based on similarities and integrating datasets.
- **[Sample Deconvolution](#vireo)**: Disentangling mixtures of cells from different donors.
- **[Doublet Detection](#doublet-detection)**: Identifying artificial doublet cells.
- **[Genotype Matching](#vireo)**: Determining sample matches through genotype comparison.
- **[Inferred Genotypes](#infered_gt)**: Vireo and Freebayes generated VCF files for each deconvoluted donor in the pool.
- **[Handover](#handover)**: Storage of summary statistics, plots, and final QC'd and annotated H5AD files per donor.
- **[Merged H5AD Files](#merged-h5ad-files)**: Consolidated H5AD files from various preprocessing steps, enabling restarts from the clustering phase.
- **[NF-Preprocessing](#ambient-rna-removal)**: Includes CellBender results for ambient RNA removal.
- **[Pipeline Info](#pipeline_info)**: Statistics and logs from the pipeline execution.
- **[Plots](#plots)**: A collection of quality control visualizations.
- **Resources**: Reference genomes utilized in data processing.
- **UMAPS**: Quick-reference UMAP plots for data visualization.

Detailed explanations of each step and the corresponding outputs are provided below:


## Alignment step
#### [Cellranger](#Cellranger) - Curently users have to run Cellranger upstream of pipeline - we suggest to use the [no-cores pipeline](https://nf-co.re/scrnaseq/2.5.1) - https://nf-co.re/scrnaseq/2.5.1
## Ambient RNA removal
### [Ambient RNA Removal using Cellbender](#Cellbender) 
Reads the Cellranger outputs and removes the ambient RNA using [Cellbender](https://github.com/broadinstitute/CellBender)

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output file structure ( nf-preprocessing/cellbender ):</summary>

*   Here we have multiple different plots and output files, however the most important ones are the matrix and h5ad files after the ambient rna removal: such as cellbenderFPR_0pt1filtered_10x_mtx/ cellbender_FPR_0.1_filtered.h5

## Genotype processing and Donor deconvolutions 
If more than 1 donor is in the pool and Multiplet/Unassigned cell removal
###  [Genotype processing](#Genotype_processing) 
If users provide the genotypes this step slices and dices the genotypes to prepeare these for the CellSNP/Vireo deconvolutions and GT matches
### [Donor Deconvolution using CellSnp/Vireo](#CellSnp/Vireo) 
We run cellsnp and vireo to deconvolute donors if the input file has indicated that there are more than 1 donors in the pool.

### Cellsnp
Cellsnp profiles each of the droplets for the variants in them, which is later utilised by vireo to assign the particular cell to the donor cluster:

</details>

## [Genotype matching](#infered_gt)
The infered genotypes (both from Freebayes and From Vireo) will be used to double check the identities of the donors in the pool. Vireo and Freebayes are used to produce infered genotypes from scRNA data for each of the deconvoluted donors. These are then used in the bcftools gtcheck to match each of the infered genotypes against the provided genotype cohorts. This will produce statistics and info of the gt matching against the provided genotype cohorts, in particular distributions are calculated and z0 (best donor match statistic) and z1 (second best donor statistic) is calculated per cohort and then these scores are compared in between cohorts to determine best match out of all cohorts. This allows Yascp to determine which donor is the best and how well it matches the donor within each of the cohorts.

* z0 is a best gt match score as per bcftools gtcheck / SD of all scores
* z1 is the second best match as per bcftools gtcheck / SD of all scores

### Scrublet
<details markdown="1">

#### [Donor Deconvolution using Souporcell](#Souporcell) - Souporcell option both removes the ambioent RNA and deconvolutes the donors [currently however this option is broken and will be fixed soon]

#### [GT match](#GT_match) - This step utilises the prepeared genotypes and the infered genotypes by Vireo and picks out the donor that corresponds to the right reads. 

<details markdown="1">

## Celltype identification
### [Azimuth](#Azimuth) 
Uses Azimuth PBMC l2 reference (pipeline will be adjusted later to be more general for other tissue types) to assign the celltypes. Downstream it maps the l2 to l1 and l3 as per https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp/blob/main/assets/azimuth/Azimuth_Mappings.txt

Pipeline will create merged h5ad files for the most important preprocessing steps - 
* Post deconvolution and celltype assignemt merged files that contain any extra metadata provded.
* Post hard filters merged h5ad file, where cells that are not passing ceitrain thresholds are dropped (or flagged, depends on settings used)
* Post adaptive filters h5ad file where cells that dont pass these filters are dropped (or flagged depending on settings used)
Note that the Handover folder discussed next contains per donor final h5ad files that include all the information from the above mentioned files.

## [Handover](#handover)
